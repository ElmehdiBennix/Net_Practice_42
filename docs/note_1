ip address : are like phone numbers who wouldve thought 
*********************
if a device need to comunicate with another device it need an ip address
in linux bassed systsems we can use the ifconfig command
if we are using a router (WIFI) it assigns a ip address to the device

most ip address start with 192.168.1.etc between 0 and 255 because of opra in the router
it always start with that value because of the subnet mask (read down)

    each cobination of numbers between . its called octats

subnet mask : kinda of the street we live in u already know if ;y phone need to talk to ;y
                computer the subnet can just tell me we are in the same network
***************************

if u see a 255.255.255.0 that number is locked if it has 255 meaning the ip address
will always start with 192.168.1.(value) because its 0 in the subnetmask it can be eny
value ranging between 0 and 255

    we call the locked numbers as the network portion of the ip adress and the 
    value as host number


default gatewat :
****************************

its the router 
if eny of the devices wants to talk to eny thing in the internet outside the network it talks
to default gateway which is the router 192.168.1.1 because the router is the one connected 
to the internet provider and knows where to go


****** ----> first ip address in the network is reserved for the network address and the last for
the podcast address which tells broadcast then we have default gateway which is the router ip adress


there is a ip adress that gets out of the router to the internet which is diffrent then the on in the netzork
